# Comparing VADER and FinBERT Sentiment Models for Forecasting S&P 500 Index with LSTM, 2021-2022

This repository is part of the Master Thesis about "Comparing VADER and FinBERT Sentiment Models for Forecasting S&P 500 Index with LSTM, 2021-2022".

This thesis compares the predictive accuracy of the lexicon-based VADER and the pre-trained FinBERT sentiment model within the LSTM framework. The study's core focus is the 
prediction of the next-day closing price of the S&P 500 index in the period 2021-2022. The models are trained using news headlines by various outlets published on “investing.com” in the 
timeframe 2016-2021. The results indicate that FinBERT's pre-trained model, which is specifically designed for the financial context, significantly outperforms the generic VADER
lexicon-based model in the evaluation metrics RMSE, MAPE, and R-squared. These findings suggest the adoption of domain-specific sentiment analysis in improving the predictive power
of stock price forecasting LSTM models, potentially offering a substantial advantage for market participants.
